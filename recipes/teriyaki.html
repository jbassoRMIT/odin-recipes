    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This grilled teriyaki chicken is very easy to prepare and great
        for a hot summer's evening. Leftovers are delicious on a green
        salad or in a sandwich. Be sure to grill very hot and very fast.

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk teriyaki sauce, lemon juice, garlic, and sesame oil together in a bowl and
            pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with marinade, squeeze out
            excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour
            to overnight, turning every so often.
        </li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and l
            ightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the
            juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted
            into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
