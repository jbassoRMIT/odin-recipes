    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets and a
            9x13-inch baking dish with 1 teaspoon olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together eggs and water in a shallow dish. Combine Parmesan cheese,
            bread crumbs, salt, and pepper in a separate shallow dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dip eggplant slices into egg mixture, then press into bread crumb mixture.
            Gently tap off any excess crumbs. Arrange breaded eggplant slices on the prepared
            baking sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
            Flip eggplant and continue baking until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
            Stir in ground beef; season with salt and pepper.
            Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes.
            Drain excess grease. Stir tomato sauce into ground beef;
            bring to a simmer, then set sauce aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place 1/3 of the eggplant slices on the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
            Pour 1/3 of the meat sauce on top of eggplant layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese on top of sauce layer. Repeat this step
            2 more times, finishing with a layer of mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling,
            10 to 15 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before slicing.
